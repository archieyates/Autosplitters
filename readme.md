# Autosplitters
Provided are some [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) scripts for Kula World and Valkyria Chronicles.

## Valkyria Chronicles - WIP
This autosplitter is a **Work in progress**. See below for details of supported feature sets.

### Full Features
- Automatically split on final hit on Maximillian

### Partial Features
- Partial load removal (does not cover the entire load screen)
- Support for multiple versions of the game (currently no automatic version detection)

### Planned Features
- Full load removal
- Automatic detection of game version
- Automatic splits on "Operation Complete" screen

### Supported Versions
- Steam
- Game Pass

There is no automated version detection so user is currently required to remove the version they aren't using from the file

## Kula World
### Features
- Automatic splits at the end of each level
- Option to toggle splits at the end of each world instead

### Supported Versions
- Supports *SLUS-00724* of **Roll Away** (the alternate name for the game) running on *ePSXe* version *2.0*

If you have an unsupported version of the title (not the emulator) feel free to contact me to get it added
