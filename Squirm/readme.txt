For the Squirm autosplitter to work a few things must be checked.

The game must be Version 3.0 (latest) version as the autosplitter relies on the save file changes made in that version.

You must have an environment variable set up called "squirm" that points at the SQUIRM folder in your steam directory.

on Windows you can do this by:
- Make sure LiveSplit is closed first
- hitting Windows Key & R to bring up the Run prompt
- entering "sysdm.cpl" and hitting "OK"
- On the System Properties windo click the "Advanced" tab
- Select the "Environment Variables" button
- Click "New" under the "User variables" section
- Call your new variable "squirm" (all lower case)
- The path of the variable should be to your SQUIRM folder in the steam directory
- e.g. E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SQUIRM
- Once this is done you can re-open Livesplit
